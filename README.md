### How It Works

The `Simple-Gym-management-System` repository is a Java-based application designed for managing gym memberships. It uses object-oriented programming principles to handle various aspects of gym management. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality:

- **Membership Management**: The system allows for adding, updating, and removing members. Each member’s details, such as name, age, membership type, and contact information, are stored and managed.
- **Membership Plans**: Different membership plans can be defined and assigned to members.
- **Attendance Tracking**: The system tracks the attendance of members, logging the number of days attended.
- **Role Management**: The application manages different roles within the gym, such as trainers and staff.

### How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/krishnapatel36/Simple-Gym-management-System.git
   cd Simple-Gym-management-System
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
   - Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Compile and run the main class (`Main.java` or equivalent).
   - Interact with the console-based interface to add, update, or remove members, assign membership plans, and track attendance.
